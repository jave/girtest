* girtest
This is a pretty dumb dumper for gobject introspection(GIR) data.  I
wrote it because I wanted to use GIR in two different projects, but
each time I was baffled by the documentation.

I found this weird, since I've used several introspection systems, and
havent had any particular issues with those.

So, girtest is only meant to be used to understand GIR. As such, it
was written mostly by Emacs macrology on the GIR docs.

** building
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs  gobject-introspection-1.0` girtest.c
